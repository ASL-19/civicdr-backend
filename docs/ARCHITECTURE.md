## üè° Architecture

### üó∫ Overview

The system is composed of:

 - ExpressJS API that serves data over REST
 - Postgres Database for storage
 - Authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens

### üì¶ Database
![Database Model](schema.png)

### üôÖ Authentication

Authentication with the API is done by sending an `Authorization` header containing a valid [JWT](https://jwt.io). The API checks the JWT signature using the environment variable `JWT_SECRET`. For more information, you can read the documentation of [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt).

### üëÆ Authorization

A valid JWT should encode a `roles` array that contains the type of user that is accessing the resource. The array items can be one of `Admin`, `IP` or `SP`. An admin has access to all resources, `IP` and `SP` only have access to certain routes and certain database columns. This is enforced as route middleware in `lib.js` for every route, and using the rules in `permissions/*`.

The profile of a user is tied to the JWT `sub` field, and the profile of the user is retrieved by matching `sub` to the `openid` field in either the `ip_profiles` or `sp_profiles` DB table. Admin users do not have profiles.

### üîî Notifications

Certain types of database transactions are logged in the `reads` table so that we can notify users of future changes.
Requests to the following routes will write to this table with `ticket_id`, `user_type`, and `user_id`:

- `/tickets/*`
- `/threads/:thread_id/messages` (recorded as a read of the parent ticket)

The `ticket` objects returned from `/tickets` and `/tickets/:id` contain a property `notify` which is created with the following logic:

- If a relevant entry is found on the read table (matches ticket id and user information):
  - If the ticket has been updated since the last read `notify: true`
  - If any of the threads that the user can read have been updated since the last read `notify: true`
  - Otherwise, `notify: false`  
- If no entry is found, `notify: true`

### ‚úâÔ∏è Email

Pending email transactions are created for the following actions:

- IP
  - Ticket status changes
  - New comments in a thread
- SP
  - Ticket status changes
  - New comments in a thread
  - Assigned to a ticket
- Admin
  - When a new ticket is created
  - Updates to IP/SP Profiles

These pending transactions are stored in the DB table `emails`. On a schedule, we run `clock.js` which creates one email per unique address in the pending records. These emails are queued and sent via [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/).

### ‚ú®Logs

Logging is configurable via the `LOG_DIRECTORY` environment variable. There are four daily rotated log files:

- `yyyy-mm-dd-api-info-log`: Info level logs for the API. Contains access logs as well as which `openid` made the request. Each request is assigned a unique ID. The request is logged as "id", "response time" followed by the [Apache Combined Log Format](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan#combined)
- `yyyy-mm-dd-api-error-log`: Errors from the API
- `yyyy-mm-dd-mailer-info-log`: Info level logs from the mailer process
- `yyyy-mm-dd-mailer-error-log`: Errors from the mailer process

```
